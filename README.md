# Lightning Lanes!
These can be puchased on **April 27th at 7am** EST!

There are three different types of Lightning Lane:

* **Lightning Lane SinglePass** - These are *per ride* for the most popular rides at the park. Each park has at least ONE of these (Magic Kingdom has 2).
* **Lightning Lane MultiPass** - Most rides at the park fall under this category. The multipass allows you to schedule rides in advance and can be purchased 7 days prior to your trip for every park day of your trip.
* **Lightning Lane PremierPass** - Is the most expensive option (upwards of $400 per person in some cases)... don't bother. 

Pricing varies, but for *Lightning Lane Multipass* the totals are usually (per person):

* Magic Kingdom: ~$35
* EPCOT: ~$28
* Hollywood Studios: ~$32
* Animal Kingdom: ~$25

Some **stage shows** are also eligble for Lightning Lanes. Using reservation on a show grants you a better seat for the experience.
